pulp_db is a NoSQL database.
It was written for realtime, jagged (hard to schema) data streams.  Days of immutable data.
It indexes the main data. Also supports field index and quering.
It supports indexing.

Optimised for high throughput.
It uses a two stage write process to achive this.  The offline one automatcially optimises the indexes. 
Most data is immutable. We can use more specialised data structures if we don't need to support insertion once the db has been written.

Optimised for low memory usage in read mode.
Can also be used to index and markup a flat file of data.

Supports python and pypy query front end.



Things todo.
Migrate tests to commmon folder
converter: rtrie to ttrie.  Nibble from the bottom not gulp from the top.
Investigate encoding.
Thing about dpref. How could we make this more sequential.
Inconsitant return if true ttrie__get, rtrie__get NULL fail, else found, 1 fail, 0 found.  MAKE THE WORLD CONSISTANT!
I could really cut down in the api by having void pointers.  That are cast a run time.
