The idea here is to anaylsis a trie and know what weights to give to differet binary elements.  We then can space out the known data to match and ahave a calculated hash function return that data.


Can we do the same dymanically.



Hash tables ussualy store, key, val at each hash address. Then we move through a bucket looking for the key once the expected position is calculated.


In such an thing, order can be gureenteed.
We don't need to store the key as the hash guarentees that each element will match.

We really turnings a graph with a complex curve into a straight line.

What we really want the is to somehow use all those spaces between data to actully mean something.
