 much smaller domain.  Don't need as many huge numbers.  Most are smaller pertibations.

Xor trie

11011
11101
10001

How can we store these?

Eaqch level we apply them.  Don't need the full binary range?

Each level looks like : [256byte, xor_data]

Instead of 4bytes each to represent each int, we only need a few. It is very similar to just sorting and storing the diffs



[xor_root]
   |     \
[data] [data]
   |
[data]
