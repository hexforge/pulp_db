Block based version of double array trie.  The aim is to not have to repeat check sources all over the place.

It like a radix trie as if a node only has one child then they packed into a tail.
One one src trie and use a target trie this is enforced and saves us a byte.

256 fixed width.  Pack others into same one.



source table. As each node must have 2>= children.  We need to be able to address up to 128 parent nodes.
128 elements each of 4 bytes.  3 bytes is a src table check. 1 byte is an source shift so we can pack different groups together.


filter index
256 elements of 1 byte each.  7bits can address 128.  1bit is a flag.

target store
256 elements of 4 bytes. (First 2 bits are a flag.)  Is an index if value, is a 3 byte table address if not.




Better schme.

filter flags:
    flag in filter means message no message

target store flags:
    2flag   first flag: special message
            second flag: means passthough
