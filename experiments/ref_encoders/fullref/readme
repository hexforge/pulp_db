fullref. Where every message has the keyval.
Everything is true.

(key=A)[1] == msg[1]
(key=A)[23]==msg[23]


No need to store

has_keyval [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...]
refs=      [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,..]

That only needed for say some have 
has_keyval [1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,]
refs       [1,2,3,4,5,6...]
